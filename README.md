## 🕵️‍♂️ What is this?
Forget blurry traffic lights and grainy crosswalks! Conventional captchas are boring. This is a **Pokémon-themed verification system** designed to separate the true Pokémon Masters from the Team Rocket bots.

## 🎮 How it Works
To prove you are human, you must correctly identify the Pokémon displayed. 
1. A random Pokémon (or silhouette) appears.
2. You must choose the correct name from the options.
3. If you get it right, you're officially "Not a Bot" (and a great trainer).

## ✨ Features
- **"Who's That Pokémon?" Mode:** Classic silhouette-style identification.
- **Randomized Challenges:** No two captchas are the same.
- **Instant Validation:** Immediate feedback on your Pokémon knowledge.
- **Nostalgic UI:** Designed to bring back those GameBoy Color vibes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with a touch of nostalgia.

## 🚀 Quick Start

3. **Catch 'em all!**
